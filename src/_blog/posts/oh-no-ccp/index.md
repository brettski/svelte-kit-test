I will not take back my kudos though, you still deserve that. This issue still has me rolling on the floor in laughter.

I log into [EVE](https://secure.eve-online.com/ft/?aid=102929) this afternoon to see this big banner saying DON'T REBOOT! If you have loaded the premium graphics after 0400 GMT, DON'T reboot without checking some link first.

Well of course I rebooted, I shut down for the night. This morning I started my machine to discover that my boot.ini file was invalid. I freaked, it's not like I have enough going on with my workplace. After running tests on the hdd and determining that it's healthy, I did a look for "Invalid boot.ini" and discovered how to [fix it.](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/330184)

Here is one of there [links](http://www.eve.is/news/newsOfEve.asp?newsID=500), and it's kind of a joke, because who is going to see it? Not many, at least in the states, as it was anyone after 0900 cst, who is effected. Bummer, does this mean I can't play until they fix this bug? I'll have to read more, it seems only to be happening after the load, not playing.

Damn, just thought of something, I loaded it on my home machine too last night. I am going to have to fix that now too.
