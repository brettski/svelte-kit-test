I back at it and nothing is safe this year.  I can't take the clutter, it's just too much for one person to bear.  If my wife gets in my way she may be surprised when 'stuff' just starts vanishing.  Hey, you don't want to clean, than I am making a decision on that 'thing' that has been on the dining room floor for two years.

In boxes, empty; receipt stacks,  gone; toys, age appropriate only otherwise, GONE.  We could open our own toy store, I swear.  Actually we will be, in the form of a garage sale this Summer.  Come one by and buy our stuff, we don't want it anymore.

I feel better already.

For the record, I started the humongo pile in the corner of the office tonight.  Already have my first bag of trash for the landfill.

If you actually read this far you are probably thinking I am crazy, and you are half right, but you really need to try this, it is such great therapy.  Try this for size; you open your most used email client and there are zero emails in the inbox.  Everything you need is in a folder, everything else is GONE.  Honestly, how many times do you look at those 2312 emails in your inbox now, really?  Probably only the first time you read it.

I will let you in on a little secret for all those emails that you can't get rid of.  You can't leave them in your inbox, that's just clutter and stressful.  Create one folder named **archive** and stick all that clutter email that you just can't do without in there.  That simple move can clear up any email you 'just not sure about deleting.'

Everything else DELETE!

If you are more anal, like I am , create a few folders and organize your emails more.  Google nailed on the head when they went with the search model of Gmail.  Absolute brilliance.

Another little tip.  If you are replying to an email with a question and the original doesn't really matter, then DELETE it.  Why keep it, you will get it back with your next round of emails.

PURGE

Can't wait to start in the freak'n garage.  I want my garage back!
