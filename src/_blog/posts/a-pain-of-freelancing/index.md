I know I am not the first one to bring this up by any means, but it's really bugging me.  I have done OK this year with my freelancing.  It hasn't been too much work where I am enslaved completely, but enough to help with the bills around the house.  Supporting a stay-at-home mom and two kids burns money faster than I could ever imagine.  So most of what I have made has been burned away, and nothing has been paid toward taxes.  I know it will be a lot, but how much? A headline caught my eye ([Extremely Important Tax Rules for Designers in the United States](http://blog.themeforest.net/general/extremely-important-tax-rules-for-freelance-designers-in-the-united-states/), at [In The Woods](http://blog.themeforest.net/) \[an [rss](http://feeds.feedburner.com/themeforest) I watch\]) and basically kicked me in the butt to look into this before I am sitting down filling out my 1040.[](http://blog.themeforest.net/general/extremely-important-tax-rules-for-freelance-designers-in-the-united-states/)

With the year winding down, I am thinking about my tax return for this year and how my added freelance-earned money may effect it.  Well as I have read into it, it will effect it a lot!  One helpful article I found on the matter is, [Taxes and Freelancing](http://taxes.about.com/od/taxplanning/a/freelance.htm) at About.com.  This article coverd much of the basics and has some good pointers on getting organized and what information you will want for filling out Schedule C on your tax return. The article supplied better information the the In The Woods one.

So, sure that is a bit of a pain, a lot more to organize and keep track of, but one of the biggest part of the pain is Self-Employment Tax.  What is Self-Employment tax, well in a nutshell its the Social Security and Medicare taxes you pay on any net profits you have.

The Self-Employment tax is 15.3% -- Social Security Tax is 6.2% and Medicare Tax is 1.45%.  Wait you say, that only comes to 7.65%, and you are correct, though since you are self employed, you must pay the employee and employer portion of the tax.  7.65% times two is 15.3%.  For those of you who are a bit curious yes, if you are a W2 employee you pay 7.65% in Social Security and Medicare taxes.  Please note, in 2009 Social Security tax is only paid on the first $102,000 subject to Social Security tax.  I am sure this will play into your Self-Employment tax number too, though I don't know for sure.  I can speak more to this once I go through it next February and if I make it over that amount

Please realize, I am not a tax accountant or CPA nor do I play one on TV.  The information written here is solely based on my readings and limited experience.  Consume it at your own risk.
