It's Earth Day which has grown into Earth Week.  Hopefully by the time my kids are my age it will be Earth Month or even Earth Year! I mean it needs to be part of our everyday lives.[![Earth Picture](images/globe_west_2048.jpg?w=150)](images/globe_west_2048.jpg)

So for Earth Day I have a list of 25 ways to help keep this beautiful blue ball stay that way.

1. Recycle all the paper, plastic, glass and metal products you can.
2. Always put garbage in its proper place--garbage can or recycling bin.
3. Write or draw on both sides of a piece of paper before recycling it.
4. Print sheets of paper from your computer only if you really need them.
5. Use sponges, rags and cloth napkins instead of paper products.
6. Carry your lunch in a reusable box or bag.
7. Bike, walk or ride the bus instead of taking the car. Plus its cheaper than the gym.
8. Check to see that your car's tires are properly inflated.  I hear nitrogen assists with gas mileage as well.
9. If the car you are in is going to be stopped for more than a minute ask the driver to turn it off.  Probably not at stoplights though.
10. Replace burnt-out bulbs at home with compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs. I hear these may contain mercury, any truth to that? Can they be recycled?
11. Turn off the lights, computer, radio, stereo and TV when you leave a room.
12. Sit near a window when you read instead of turning on a light
13. Set the thermostat a little lower in the winter and a little higher in the summer.
14. Wash clothes in cold water and hang them out to dry.
15. Don't turn the dishwasher on until it is full.
16. Take short showers to save energy and water.
17. Turn off the faucet while you brush your teeth.
18. Put leftover food in reusable containers, not in plastic wrap or foil.
19. Wash and reuse glass jars, plastic containers and plastic utensils.
20. When shopping, look for items made out of recycled materials.
21. Bring your own reusable bags when shopping.
22. Mend and repair clothes and toys rather than buying new ones.
23. Create a compost pile of food scraps and plant cuttings
24. Buy food at local farmers' markets.
25. Volunteer for community events, such as a cleanup day at the park.

How many of these do you follow regularly?

Any you disagree with?

Happy Earth Day and remember to take care of our home!
