A day or two ago I wrote about and [incident](http://brettski111.wordpress.com/2008/03/25/a-big-scare-in-the-mall/) my wife had at the mall in [RainForest](http://rainforestcafe.com/) Cafe. I had emailed [Landry's](http://www.landrysrestaurants.com) Restaurants, owners of RainForest cafe, and actually received a quick response back (today).Â  I have emailed my phone number back to them, lets see how this progresses.

Emailed received:
