While reading the news on [myyahoo](http://my.yahoo.com) today I came across this [story](http://news.yahoo.com/s/space/20070607/sc_space/mostdistantblackholediscovered;_ylt=Aip7l_JXSGF8CiCmeIWh2hoE1vAI) about a black hole found 13 Billion light years away. As I thought about it, I really realized that 13 billion light years is a completely incomprehensible distance. So being the curious type that I am I set out to find out how far that really is.

I started out by looking up some values:

Astronomical Unit (AU): 1 AU = 149,598,000 Km (kilometers)

Light-year (ly) : 1 ly = 63239.6717 AU

So:

13,000,000,000 ly \* 63239.6717 = 822,000,000,000,000 AU

822,000,000,000,000 \* 149,598,000 = 123,000,000,000,000,000,000,000Km

Hmm...

so there are 123 x 10^21 km in 13 billion light-years or 76.4 X 10^21 miles for us here in the States.

OK, that didn't help at all. Like I said, completely incomprehensible
